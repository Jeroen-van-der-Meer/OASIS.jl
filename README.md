# OasisTools.jl

Toolkit for working with Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (OASIS) files. Work in progress.

## Installation

```
pkg> dev https://github.com/Jeroen-van-der-Meer/OasisTools.jl.git
```

Note that this package is not yet in the Julia repository.

## Getting started

To read the contents of an OASIS file, use the `oasisread` function.

```julia
using OasisTools
filepath = "./test/testdata/nested.oas"
oasisread(filepath)
```

```
OASIS file v1.0 with the following cells: 
TOP
├─ BOTTOM2 (3×)
│  └─ ROCKBOTTOM
├─ MIDDLE2
│  └─ BOTTOM (2×)
└─ MIDDLE
   ├─ BOTTOM2 (2×)
   │  └─ ⋯
   └─ BOTTOM
```

It returns an `Oasis` object, which contains a list of all the cells in your OASIS file, in the form of a `Cell` object. Each cell, in turn, has a list of shapes (encoded as `Shape` objects), as well as a list of cells (i.e. placements of other cells within the specified cell).

# To do

- If your OASIS file has been generated by software *other than* klayout, then it is not unlikely that your file will be parsed incorrectly. The reason is that klayout uses only a small part of the OASIS specification, and the parts that aren't used have not been thoroughly tested.
- Properties are currently ignored.
- Backwards-compatible extensions are not supported. You will get an error if your file contains any.
- It is not yet possible to write an OASIS file.
- One day there will be functionality to visually display your layout &mdash; stay tuned.
